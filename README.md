### Hi, I'm Jheimer!

>MY AIM IS: BUILD BEST Foundation LLM Model and AGI/ASI.<br>

A tech enthusiast who loves learning and building in AI/ML, low-level programming, and understanding how things truly work from computers, AI models, websites, OS, kernels, rockets, jet engines, hardware, and even nuclear science, physics and mathmatics.
I want to learn everything I possibly can.

> As humans and youth, our main priority should be helping humanity achieve greatness in intelligence, technology, and even becoming multi-planetary.

> My Inspiration and Competitor is Elon Musk in my different ideology:

Because these days his focus is profit and control over industries.<br>
He said: “OpenAI started as an open-source organization, but when they know that AI is a big thing, they changed the whole structure and turned OpenAI into a closed-source company. That’s why I left OpenAI.”<br>
After this, he said a lot of bad things about Sam Altman: “He only cares about profit, he well destory humanity. I care about humanity, that’s why I left.”
And then… he started an AI company GrokAI, but it’s also closed source. Which means this hypocritic man thinks humanity needs another paid ai model, profit-driven organization.<br>
Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg released LLaMA 3 and 3.1 as open-source models. Elon always says: “Mark isn’t a good guy” but Mark actually did something that every AI learner, developer, and researcher needed: open-source models to fine-tune and train.<br>
So Elon Musk is the biggest hypocrite I’ve ever seen. These days, he’s just hunting industries for profit, not for humanity.<br>
We have to understand this. And even if you don’t understand, I don’t care.<br>
👉 He is my biggest and only competitor.<br>
👉 I will release the best AGI and ASI for free so any researcher, developer, or even someone who can’t afford expensive AI agents can still use them.<br>
He isn’t going to change humanity.<br>
But, I will. 100%, Yeah.<br>
> I love mark Zuckerberg for his Llama open source Foundation model, even under LOC, That's why I love this guy. I love to work with him in the future releted AGI/ASI<br>
